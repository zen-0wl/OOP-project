# OOP-project

 > The program is an adventure-shooter game.
 >
 > ● There are three classes of objects used.
 >
 > ● The interaction of the objects involve between:
 >
 > ○ A hunter
 > ○ The Birds
 > ○ The Arrows which the hunter will use as weapons
 >
 > ● The game theme is where the player logs in as a hunter character and it takes place
in a forest themed environment. The hunter is placed in the forest with a quiver
holding a set of arrows for the hunt. The birds are positioned in a random manner
which the hunter has to hunt down until the time ticks down ..! 

**How it works?**
1. A player will enter his/her name before the game starts.
2. A player will start the game with the easy level as a Single-Star Hunter.
3. About 5 birds will appear in scattered.
4. The hunter need to shoot the birds using the arrows.
5. After succeed, the player will go the next level as a Double-Star Hunter
and last level as a Triple-Star Hunter.
6. Each levels will be given different amount of arrows, different number of
birds appeared and the time limit will decrease.
7. To win the game, the hunter need shoots all the birds for each level.
8. If the hunter runs out of arrows/miss the birds/time is up, game over.

P.S The program is written in Java in order to satiate project requirements. It can be viewable in the platform Greenfoot.
